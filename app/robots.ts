  // hreflang strategy. Left crawlable they are ~244k duplicate URLs whose every
  // fetch is an on-demand ISR render (a billed write + origin transfer each).
  // Blocking both `/xx/` (subpaths) and `/xx$` (the bare locale home; plain
  // `/xx` would also block /hierarchy et al.) stops that crawl spend. The
  // trade-off is deliberate: a robots-blocked URL is never fetched, so the
  // canonical tags on blocked variants are invisible - a prefixed URL that was
  // already indexed via an external link freezes as a URL-only entry rather
  // than consolidating. /en/ stays crawlable on purpose: it is the prefix most
  // likely to collect external links, and leaving it fetchable lets its
  // canonicals collapse those duplicates into the clean URLs.
