      <p>
        This site is an information tool, not a verdict. We publish sourced facts and two separate,
        clearly-labelled measures. We never combine them into a single score, and we never editorialise.
      </p>

      <h2>Two independent axes</h2>
      <p>
        Every representative is shown on two axes that are stored and computed separately, so that public
        opinion can never move the factual measure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Verified Performance</strong> — built <em>only</em> from official, government-sourced data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public Sentiment</strong> — open public ratings. This is opinion, explicitly labelled
          “not verified”.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Verified Performance</h2>
      <p>
        For Members of Parliament we use official parliamentary metrics: attendance, questions asked, debates
        participated in, private member bills, and constituency-fund (MPLADS) utilisation. Each metric is
        converted to a <strong>percentile within a comparable cohort</strong> — the same house and tenure
        bracket — and the percentiles are averaged with <strong>equal weight</strong>. The formula is public
        and unweighted by us on purpose: we do not assign subjective importance to any metric.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ministers and presiding officers are exempt from questions/debates by parliamentary convention, so those metrics are excluded for them rather than counted as zero.</li>
        <li>Declared assets and criminal cases are shown as neutral factual context and are <strong>not</strong> scored.</li>
        <li>Where data is missing, we show “unavailable” — never a zero.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Public Sentiment</h2>
      <p>
        Ratings (1–5) are collected without login. To keep thin or coordinated samples from distorting the
        picture we apply <strong>Bayesian shrinkage</strong>: a rating with few votes stays near the neutral
        mean until enough independent votes accumulate. We display the full distribution, the vote count, and a
        confidence indicator so you can judge for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vote integrity is layered: a Cloudflare Turnstile human-check, a soft device signal, and rate limiting
        on a hashed, coarsened IP, with one updatable vote per person. No login-less system is perfect; a
        determined attacker can still get through, which is exactly why sentiment is kept separate from the
        verified measure and labelled as opinion.
      </p>

      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>
        “No citation, no claim.” Identity and cross-references come from Wikidata; declared assets, education
        and criminal cases from Election Commission affidavits; parliamentary activity from official Sansad /
        PRS records. Every fact links to its source and shows the date it was retrieved.
      </p>

      <h2>Corrections</h2>
      <p>
        We offer a <Link href="/grievance">right to reply and a correction process</Link>. If a fact is wrong or
        out of date, tell us and we will review it. Our code and data are intended to be open source.
